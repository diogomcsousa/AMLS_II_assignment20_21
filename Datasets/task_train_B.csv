murray,negative,#USOpen Anderson beat Murray in the 4th round. It's Murray's earliest Grand Slam exit in 5 years
murray,negative,@SkySportsTennis Murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing Djokovic
murray,negative,@SkySportsTennis it's a joke! Troicki v young into a 5th set and on Sky go we are forced to watch Murray walking into the practice court???
murray,negative,@cake_sports Haven't seen it yet. Caught end of Murray loss lights and interview. SVP is that dude though. 1st show.
murray,negative,@maxcouch @roryjiwani @Alex_0wen @DanBarberTF @Tennisratings Murray will never win a slam again unless he changes. 2nd serve a joke
murray,negative,Anderson absolutely killed Murray in the 4th set tie break 7-0 to win the match. How embarrassing for Murray
murray,negative,Andy broken to start the 3rd set; still complaining to chair ump that 5 minutes is excessive bathroom usage time. Murray's so done. #USOpen
murray,negative,Beginning to worry Murray may be stuck on two grand slams for the rest of his career.
murray,negative,"Booo, Murray gets broke early in the 2nd set. It's not as if he's playing bad, Anderson is playing exceptional tennis here. #USOpen"
murray,negative,I LOVE how aggressive both Serena &amp; Venus are being off the 2nd serve return. Murray would lose this match! @cbfowler @bgtennisnation
murray,negative,If Murray loses this 2nd set I'm pretty sure he won't win this.
murray,negative,Murray about as dead as the aliens in Independence Day on July 4th in #America. They die in the movie either way but worse on the 4th. #Dead
murray,negative,Murray always struggles on Louis Armstrong. How pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?
murray,negative,Murray been broken in the 3rd. Unreal. Straight sets loss would make my day
murray,negative,Murray blew it! Just couldn't handle Anderson's first serve in the 4th set.
murray,negative,"Murray in real trouble now, down a break in the 3rd #USOpen Looking angry and frustrated"
murray,negative,"Murray is beaten before the QF of a Grand Slam for the first time in five years. Anderson, magnificent throughout, took 4th set tiebreak 7-0"
murray,negative,Murray misses a good chance to break at the start of the 4th. Sloppy along with a brilliant shot from Anderson denies the break. #USOpen
murray,negative,"Murray with a splendid array of swear words at the end of the 2nd set. Sitting there with the commentator having to say, ""sorry.  sorry."""
murray,negative,Murray's in major crisis here - 5 - 1 down in the 2nd set after losing the 1st! scenes!!

murray,positive,"15-30 on Murray's serve, but the Scot more up than down finally and grabs the hold of serve with a couple of aces.  Andy up 4-3* 3rd set."
murray,positive,4th set point in this game and  challenge called in. Anderson 2-0 sets. Murray much more promising at the end of the 2nd. He's not out yet!
murray,positive,@Betweenthehedge @VivianJo1 @cosmosmom1952 Don't you just love them to pieces?!?! Murray is my 3rd. I can only handle one at a time tho. lol
murray,positive,@BrainGameTennis If Murray takes 3rd set I think he'll win
murray,positive,@DareToHart i'm not a huge fan myself but you know Murray will probably comeback in the 3rd &amp; 4th set knowing him.
murray,positive,"@GolfYeezus @S1NGH7 yeah Murray 1st/2nd, sproles for the 3rd down td lol"
murray,positive,"@Joannalangfield Concerned. If Murray can win this 3rd set, I think/hope he can win the match :)"
murray,positive,"@JoshCollacchi to be honest, I'd let Murray run it every time, even on 4th and 35, than let Trey throw."
murray,positive,"@KCChiefs_58 well, I think KC may have a good QB for the future in Murray."
murray,positive,@LewisKing__ @LouisWhyman @DCBlueStar I'm saying Murray was good but it great. Randle and dmc are just as good if it better. CM is 4th RB
murray,positive,"@Linda_Grace74 I can't see the tennis either, gutted I never sat the football but it looks like it's sky again for Murray?"
murray,positive,@MurrayBarnett thanks for hosting us Murray. Had a great time. Good luck for the cup. May the best team win. They usually do.
murray,positive,@ScottSFTC I wish I had seen your picks earlier after the day I had!!! Murray won 3-0 so your 2nd pick didn't hit. GL
murray,positive,"@SeanTierneyTSS If Murray comes back well, he'll be the 2nd/3rd best D maybe Johnson. I'd want him for the Leafs for sure."
murray,positive,@SkySportsTennis it's why I love tennis. One minute looks like murray is down and out. Next minute anything is possible! C'mon @andy_murray
murray,positive,@SkySportsTennis the later i stay up the better...c'mon Murray!
murray,positive,@andy_murray knows how to wring my nerves! Talk about tension and it's only the 1st set :-) Brilliant stuff. Behind you all the way Murray!
murray,positive,@andy_murray wins 3rd set to get back into the match but @kevinanderson18 still leads 6-7 3-6 7-6 Murray has won 8 times from 2 sets down.
murray,positive,"@kevinanderson18 you're serving big tonight, you'll play Murray on Monday and you'll struggle to get your first serves in play."
murray,positive,"@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!"
murray,positive,@serialsockthief Definitely although I think if Murray does enough to win the 4th set he'll go on and win it.
murray,positive,"@tgawd____ trash OL? Theyve looked excellent so far. Trash RBs?J-Stew ran for 486 yards in the final 5 games last season, 2nd only to Murray"
murray,positive,@usopen Ofcourse! Looking forward to Murray's 4th round game against the big-serving Anderson. A potential 5-setter. #usopen #nightshift
murray,positive,A good  hold from Murray. 5-3 in 2nd. How is Anderson's head coping with this now?
murray,positive,A lot has happened while I was away sprain-spraying my ankle. Murray has taken the 1st set 6-3 in 50 mins &amp; is up a break at 2-1 in the 2nd.
murray,positive,Anderson beats Murray in the 4th round #USOpen2015 excellent game. #WellPlayed. http://t.co/Z2dFO2XQCs
murray,positive,Anderson stopped at the donation station. Murray on way back from 2 sets down!! C'mon Andy!
murray,positive,Anderson takes a toilet break. He's up 2 sets but doesn't really have the momentum. Murray finished 2nd set stronger.
murray,positive,Assuming Murray pulls it out here all 4 matches on Monday will be very intriguing.
murray,positive,Bellucci played a great 3rd set but Murray was just too good. He advances into week 2 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 7-5 win #TeamMurray #usopen
murray,positive,Best of luck @kevinanderson18 on 4th rd @usopen vs Murray! Wish I was there to cheer you on. Go Illini!
murray,positive,Biggest game of the match. Even bigger than the 3rd set tie-break. Murray simply had to hold. Please Andy.
murray,positive,But! Murray takes the tie break in the 3rd set and we've got GAME ON! http://t.co/tzKVTmQMkL
murray,positive,Call on the field is reversed as the Aggies came up short of the 1st down. Murray and crew will go for it.

murray,positive,Come on @andy_murray!! Tempted to make my way across to Flushing Meadows on Wednesday if Murray comes back to win here! #USOpen
murray,positive,Come on Murray dig deep...I'm going to be tired for work tomorrow if I have to stay up for a 5-setter @SkySportsTennis
murray,positive,"Crew gets a fumble at the 4, Murray and the O can't punch it in. Kick a FG to make it 17-7. May be Murray's team now. Crew has been awesome."
